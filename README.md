## Description

This page showcases three projects that I worked on throughout the second year of the Frontend Development studies at NOROFF. I decided to recreate the page I made for POR1 using React for this project.

The portfolio highlights key projects, each presented with a brief description, a preview image, and links to both the GitHub repository and the live site. The page is fully responsive and structured to provide a clean and professional overview of my work.
